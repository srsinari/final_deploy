      <h3>Why did it take me two months to create this website?</h3>
      <p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      I invested a month in taking a Udemy course to learn the necessary technology. 
      The course was extensive, spanning 60 hours, 
      and I dedicated 2-3 hours of study every day during that period.<br/>
     </li>
      <li>
      After completing the course, I began working on the website during the second month. 
      In total, I created six different websites, but some of them weren't functioning properly, 
      and others lacked the desired aesthetic quality.
      </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h3>What kind of assistance was I asking from you?</h3>
      <p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      I needed all the images of you used on this website in a .doc format. I didnt ask because it would give you hint.
      </li>
      <li>
      Secondly,Regarding the choice of colors for the website. I experimented with various color combinations but struggled to make a final decision
      </li>
      <li>
      Lastly, I needed information about the dimensions of your laptop screen to ensure that the website's content would fit perfectly within its display.
      </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Why did I request your birth time?</h3>
      <p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      As you can see on the home page, I've included dynamic content that displays the years, 
      hours, minutes, and seconds since your birth. To accurately calculate this information, 
      I needed the exact time of your birth as a reference point.
     </li>
     </ul>
      </p>
    <h3> If I missed any of your questions, please don't mind; you can ask me now.</h3>
